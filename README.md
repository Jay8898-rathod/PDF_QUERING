# PDF Querying with LangChain and Open-Source Large Language Models

## Introduction
This project explores the capabilities of LangChain, a novel framework for querying PDF documents using advanced language models. By leveraging the power of open-source large language models such as GPT, BERT, or their variants, this project aims to provide a versatile solution for extracting meaningful information from PDF documents efficiently.

## Features
- **LangChain Integration:** Utilize LangChain to streamline the process of querying PDF documents.
- **Large Language Model Support:** Harness the power of pre-trained large language models to enhance query accuracy and understanding.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Enable users to query PDF documents using natural language, making the process intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Advanced Querying Capabilities:** Perform complex queries including semantic search, summarization, question answering, and more.
